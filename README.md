This is a notebook put together in Jupyter.
The program is written in Python, and displays knowledge and ability to use bagging in concert with Random Forest alogrithms for categorising and analysing different datasets.
It also demonstrates and ability to read files from CSV and wrangle them in a way that they are readible, easy to use, and free of NAN/empty spaces.
